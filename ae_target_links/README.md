## Adverse Event (AE) to target associations

Compute statistical associations between adverse events in FAERS or SIDER and targets, using previously (in other directories) created files with statistically significant drug-AE links and bioactivities integrated with plasma concentrations.

Run by executing the faers_jobs.sh and sider_jobs.sh scripts, in which the locations of necessary files must be specified.
