Integrate the experimental and predicted bioactivities with the compiled plasma concentrations using the ratio of pXC50/Cmax to assign activity calls for drug-target pairs. Predictions are only used to fill in gaps where no measurements are available, and only for targets that have at least one experimental datapoint. As a baseline dataset, activity calls are also derived using a constant cut-off of pchembl 6 (1 uM). The datasets resulting from using the constant cut-off versus the pXC50/Cmax ratio are compared in terms of differences in activity calls for the same drug-target pairs.
